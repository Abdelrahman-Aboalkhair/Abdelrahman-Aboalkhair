👋 Hi, I’m Abdelrahman!

🚀 I’m a Full-Stack Developer specializing in Next.js, Node.js, and both SQL & NoSQL, focused on building secure, performance-optimized, and responsive web applications that turn ideas into impactful solutions.

🤖 I’m also diving deep into Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), working on projects that explore how AI can be harnessed to solve real-world challenges and improve everyday experiences.

✨ What I Do:

-- Build dynamic, full-stack web applications.
-- Experiment with ML models and NLP techniques to address unique problems.

🔧 My Project Workflow:

📝 Idea Analysis & Sketching: I start by analyzing and sketching the idea in Eraser.io, including schema design and key features of the app.
🎨 UI Design: I then design the UI in Figma, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing design.
🧪 API Dev: Before writing any API logic, I write testing scripts for the API and then write the logic to pass these tests.
💻 Frontend Dev: I build the frontend from scratch, converting the Figma design into code. I create custom components like dropdowns, toasts, date pickers, and loaders without relying on third-party libraries.
🔄 State Management: I manage app state using RTK and Context API, leveraging RTK Query for efficient API requests.
⚡ Performance Optimization: I apply advanced caching techniques using Redis and implement best practices like lazy loading, code splitting, SSR, and SSG for fast, scalable performance.
🌐 SEO Optimization: I leverage Next.js features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to ensure SEO-friendly pages. I also optimize metadata (titles, descriptions, and keywords), use structured data for rich snippets, and implement lazy loading for images and content to improve page load speed.
🔒 Security: On the server side, I follow best practices for security, including encrypting sensitive data, and managing access and refresh tokens. I rotate and invalidate refresh tokens on each request to ensure maximum security.
