👋 Hi, I’m Abdelrahman!

🚀 I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer specializing in Next.js and Node.js, with a focus on creating scalable, user-friendly web applications. Whether it’s crafting seamless front-end interfaces or building efficient back-end systems, I thrive on turning ideas into impactful solutions.

🤖 I’m also diving deep into Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), working on projects that explore how AI can be harnessed to solve real-world challenges and improve everyday experiences.

✨ What I Do:

-- Build dynamic, full-stack web applications.
-- Experiment with ML models and NLP techniques to address unique problems.

🔧 My Project Workflow:

-- Idea Analysis & Sketching: I start by analyzing and sketching the idea in Eraser.io, including schema design and key features.
-- UI Design: I then design the UI in Figma, ensuring a user-friendly and scalable interface.
-- Testing: Before writing any server side logic, I write testing scripts for the API and then write the logic to pass these tests.
-- Frontend Development: I build the frontend from scratch, converting the Figma design into code. I create custom components like dropdowns, toasts, date pickers, and loaders without relying on third-party libraries.
-- State Management: I manage app state using RTK and Context API, leveraging RTK Query for efficient API requests.
-- Performance Optimization: I apply advanced caching techniques using Redis and implement best practices like lazy loading, code splitting, SSR, and SSG for fast, scalable performance.
-- Security: On the server side, I follow best practices for security, including encrypting sensitive data, and managing access and refresh tokens. I rotate and invalidate refresh tokens on each request to ensure maximum security.
