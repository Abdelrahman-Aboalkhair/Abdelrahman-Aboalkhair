👋 Hi, I’m Abdelrahman!

🚀 I’m a Full-Stack Developer specializing in Next.js, Node.js, and both SQL & NoSQL, focused on building secure, performance-optimized, and responsive web applications that turn ideas into impactful solutions.

🤖 I’m also diving deep into Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), working on projects that explore how AI can be harnessed to solve real-world challenges and improve everyday experiences.

✨ What I Do:

-- Build dynamic, full-stack web applications.
-- Experiment with ML models and NLP techniques to address unique problems.

🔧 My Project Workflow:

📝 Analyze & Sketch: Use Eraser.io for idea, schema, and feature planning.

🎨 UI Design: Design UI in Figma for a clean, user-friendly layout.

🧪 API Dev: Write tests first, then build logic to pass them.

💻 Frontend Dev: Build from scratch, creating custom components like dropdowns and toasts.

🔄 State Management: Use RTK and Context API, with RTK Query for API calls.

⚡ Performance: Optimize with Redis, lazy loading, SSR, and SSG.

🌐 SEO: Leverage SSR, SSG, and optimize metadata for SEO.

🔒 Security: Encrypt sensitive data and rotate refresh tokens for added security.
